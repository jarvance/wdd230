        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <h3>Craigslist</h3>
        <h3><a href="https://eastidaho.craigslist.org/">Website link</a></h3>
        <img id="craigslistpage" src="images\craigslist.png" alt="craigslist breaks up all options into simple categories">
        <p>Hick's law states that the more stimuli, or choices on a page, the longer users take to make decisions. Too many
            choices can cause people to be indecisive, when they normally would have. This can lead to loss of sales and revenue.
            Criagslist does a good job of categorizing everything in an easy to read and direct manner.  </p>

        <h2>White Space </h2>
        <h3>Google</h3>
        <h3><a href="https://www.google.com/">Website link</a></h3>
        <img id="googlepage" src="images\googlepage.png" alt="Google keeps it simple with lots of white space">
        <p>White space is unmarked space between elements, texts, etc. However, the space doesn't literally have to be white; colored backgrounds and patterns
            can still elevate the rest of the page. Google uses this concept very well. When making a search, the page is very clean and it's easy for the user
            to focus exactly on what he/she wants.

        <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
        <h3>Amazon</h3>
        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Website link</a></h3>
        <img id="amazonpage" src="images\amazonrule3.png" alt="Amazon clearly follows the rule of 3">
        <p>Pages and images split into thirds are naturally more appealing. Amazon splits all of its products into grids of three.</p>
